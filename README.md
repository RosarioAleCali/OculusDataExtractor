# Oculus Data Extractor
A small (for now), ongoing project to extract MEMS data from the Oculus Rift CV1 and its relevancy to simulation training in a variety of industries/fields.

### Getting Started

Getting started is easy, simply clone or fork the repo onto your local machine and import the file into your text editor or IDE.  In order for this program to run correctly, you will need to do some configuration to your build environment.  If you don't have it already, you should download the [Oculus SDK](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-sdk-for-windows/) for Windows.  The version in this project is currently 1.18.0.

Performing this work in Visual Studio 2015 myself, a link to the LibOVR library must be established for the project to compile and build.  Below is a picture for reference.
